# Pneumonia_Detection_ConvNets

RSNA Rneumonia Detection Challenge

Objective: To build an algorithm that automatically detects potential pneumonia cases

Background (From Kaggle's Description Page):

Pneumonia accounts for over 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from the disease. In the United States, pneumonia accounts for over 500,000 visits to emergency departments [1] and over 50,000 deaths in 2015 [2], keeping the ailment on the list of top 10 causes of death in the country.
While common, accurately diagnosing pneumonia is a tall order. It requires review of a chest radiograph (CXR) by highly trained specialists and confirmation through clinical history, vital signs and laboratory exams. Pneumonia usually manifests as an area or areas of increased opacity [3] on CXR. However, the diagnosis of pneumonia on CXR is complicated because of a number of other conditions in the lungs such as fluid overload (pulmonary edema), bleeding, volume loss (atelectasis or collapse), lung cancer, or post-radiation or surgical changes.
To improve the efficiency and reach of diagnostic services, the Radiological Society of North America (RSNAÂ®) has reached out to Kaggle's machine learning community.
